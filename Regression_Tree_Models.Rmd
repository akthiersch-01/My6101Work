# Technical Analysis

## Instructions

Technical analysis (R code), 25% (First attempt due: Mar 28 Monday 12:30pm)

Just before your team presentation, provide an R-markdown, or R script file, which shows the R-code and brief explanations as well as the rationale of the Exploratory Data Analysis of
your project. (Also submit your data file, or give the online source url.) This submission,
together with your final document (in part VI), will determine your teamâ€™s grade. This
document shows a technical person the math/stat/codes that you used in your analysis.

The document should include:

- Summary of the dataset
- Descriptive Statistics
- Graphical representations of the data
- [When applicable]  Measures of Variance / sd
- [When applicable]  Normality tests
- [When applicable]  Initial correlation / Chi Square tests / ANOVA analysis / Z-test or Z-interval / T-test or T-interval etc.

## Summary

The variables in the dataset are:

* `region`: name of the US Census Bureau region (name)
* `division`: name of the US Census Bureau division (contained with a census region)
* `state`: state abbreviation
* `statecode`: FIPS state code
* `countycode`: FIPS county code
* `fipscode`: 5-digit FIPS Code (county-level); combines `statecode` and `countycode`
* `county`: county name
* `year`: report release year from [County Health Rankings](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/); range of 2016-2021
* `county_ranked`: Indicates whether or not the county was ranked; 0=unranked, 1=ranked, or NA for aggregated national or state-level data
* `mental_health_days`: Average number of mentally unhealthy days reported in past 30 days (age-adjusted)
* `mental_distress_rate`: Percentage of adults reporting 14 or more days of poor mental health per month
* `inequality`: Ratio of household income at the 80th percentile to income at the 20th percentile (Income inequality)
* `median_inc`: The income where half of households in a county earn more and half of households earn less
* `hs_grad`: Percentage of adults ages 25 and over with a high school diploma or equivalent
* `college`: Percentage of adults ages 25-44 with some post-secondary education
* `unempl`: Percentage of population ages 16 and older unemployed but seeking work
* `child_poverty`: Percentage of people under age 18 in poverty
* `single_parent`: Percentage of children that live in a household headed by single parent
* `severe_housing`: Percentage of households with severe housing problems
* `food_index`: Index of factors that contribute to a healthy food environment, from 0 (worst) to 10 (best)
* `mh_providers`: rate of providers to 100,000 population
* `pop_provider_ratio`: ratio of population to mental health providers (i.e., population served per provider)
* `pop`: census population estimate
* `pct_below18`: percent of population younger than 18
* `pct_black`: percent of population that are African-American or non-Hispanic Black
* `pct_native_am`: percent of population that are Native American or Alaska Natives
* `pct_asian`: percent of population that are Asian
* `pct_pacific`: percent of population that are Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander
* `pct_hispanic`: percent of population that are Hispanic
* `pct_white`: percent of population that are non-Hispanic white or Caucasian
* `pct_female`: percent of population that are female
* `pct_rural`: percent of population that live in rural areas
